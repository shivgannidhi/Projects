Customer Churn forecasting for Dutch Energy
In this project, the aim is to predict the percentage of active connection for two different industries in Dutch Energy namely, electricity and gas. The change in the number of active connections will give insight into the number of churns. For time series two model LSTM with Neural network and ARIMA are implemented and compared. The research aims to forecast the churns for the upcoming years.
In this project we have took three companies namely coteq, Westland Infra and Rendo electricity and gas data.
We took one company data to train the model and other two companies data to test the model.
